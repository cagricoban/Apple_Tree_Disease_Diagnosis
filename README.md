# Accurate Disease Diagnosis for Sustainable Agriculture: Classification of the Health Status of Apple Trees
Correctly identifying the health status of agricultural products and implementing necessary treatments is crucial for the future of sustainable agriculture. Diagnosing diseases in agricultural products provides significant advantages in applying the correct treatment. Firstly, looking at the economic aspect, a wrong disease diagnosis can increase the input costs for the farm or farmer. This is because an incorrect diagnosis may lead to unnecessary use of pesticides and interventions. In such cases, the farm not only incurs higher costs but also reduces its productivity. Another consequence of a wrong diagnosis is the potential effects of chemicals used in treatments on the health of the plant. The treatment method applied due to an incorrect disease diagnosis can also lead to the development of resistant pathogens. This can render drugs that may be effective against a particular disease ineffective over time, necessitating more complex treatment methods.

The dataset published on the Kaggle platform is aimed at accurately classifying the health status of apple trees.
